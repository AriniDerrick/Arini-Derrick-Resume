        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am currently studying towards my Business Administration degree at the University of California, Riverside. I have collaborated on and organized a successful fundraising project due to my strongÂ skill set of teamwork and problem-solving skills. I am a quick learner and am eager to improve my skills where they are needed. I believe that these skills will further expand my career possibilities. I am excited to advance my career and apply what I have learned, my passion, and fresh ideas to make an impact on the world.

<br><br>

        I graduated from Royal High School in Simi Valley, California. During my time as a high school student, I was involved in the school's academics, athletics, and other extracurriculars such as track and field, Key Club, the National Honors Society, the California Scholarship Federation, and the Asain and East Asian Cultural Club. I took ten Advanced Placement courses in high school. I am fluent in the Thai language and am very well versed in Thai culture. I have unique experiences that can be shared and incorporated into projects to help create intriguing products for the community. Some of my other skill sets are creativity, teamwork, social media, video editing, and my ability to be adaptable.<br><br>

        My experiences include being a tutor for math for underclassmen in my high school, being the secretary of the Asain and East Asian Cultural Club (AEACC), creating the Smile of Hope Project, being part of the student council, and having a booth at the Student Equity Club Fair. During my time as the secretary of the AEACC, I took club minutes, discussed themes for meetings and fundraising opportunities, and arranged for better communication among board members. And as the creator and director of the Smile of Hope Project, in which I try to give comfort to children at the Los Angeles Children's Hospital, I organized the timeline of the project, researched hospital policies, created a flier to publicize online and around school, sold chocolate-coveredÂ strawberries to raise money, and made reports on our 50-item and 430-dollar donation. As a member of the student council, I worked with other class council members to plan and run school events such as the trunk or treat, winter formal, and senior dinner. Another notable work experience was being a member of the cultural and disability team within the Student Equity Club. I took part in creating a better environment in our school where everyone is equally involved andÂ appreciated personally and culturally, participated in the Multicultural Fair to raiseÂ awareness and show appreciation for the different cultures of our school,
and helped fundraise money.
